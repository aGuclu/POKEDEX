# POKEDEX.EXE

Project - Personal Pokedex

Project Guidelines - To create a pokemon trainer showcase website that displays information focused around 3 pokemon chosen by the student using AJAX to retrieve said data.

Goals - I wanted my Personal Pokedex to reflect an outdated UI to create a nostalgic experience for the user.  What I created is more of a Pokedex Mainframe that the user boots from a Windows95 desktop.  This Pixel font console allows the user to cycle through the first 151 Pokemon using data pulled from the PokeAPI.

Languages used - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
